<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

##  🧐 What is The Director?

The Director is an AI-powered framework that lets you interact with your video and audio collections using natural language. Forget complex tools—just tell The Director what you want, and it gets it done.

Whether you’re working with social media clips, lectures, movies, YouTube videos, or any other content, The Director enables you to:

- Summarize videos in seconds.
- Search for specific moments.
- Create clips instantly.
- Add overlays, generate thumbnails, and much more.
All powered by VideoDB’s scalable ["video-as-data"](https://videodb.io/video-as-data)ke infrastructure.

For example, a simple command like:
`Upload this video and send the highlights to my Slack,`
sets everything in motion.

Built with flexibility in mind, The Director is perfect for developers, creators, and teams looking to harness AI to simplify media workflows and unlock new possibilities. 📺 [Watch: Intro video](https://console.videodb.io/player?url=https://stream.videodb.io/v3/published/manifests/26b4143c-ed97-442a-96ae-19b53eb3bb46.m3u8)

## 💬 Running the Application

To start both the backend and frontend servers:

```bash
make run
```

This will start the backend server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and the frontend server on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

To run only the backend server: `make run-be`
To just run the frontend development server: `make run-fe`

## 📖 Documentation

The project documentation is built using MkDocs. To serve the documentation locally on port 9000:

Activate the environment and install dependencies for development:

```bash

## 📘 Creating a New Agent
To create a new agent in Director, follow these steps:

1. **Copy the template**: Duplicate `sample_agent.py` in `Director/backend/director/agents/` and rename it to your agent's name.

2. **Update class details**:
   - Rename the class (e.g., from `SampleAgent` to `YourAgentName`)
   - Update `agent_name` and `description`

3. **Modify the `run` method**:
   - Update parameters and docstring
   - Implement your agent's logic

4. **Handle output and status updates**:
   - Use appropriate content types (TextContent, VideoContent, ImageContent, SearchResultContent)
   - Update `self.output_message.actions` for progress indicators
   - Use `push_update()` to emit progress events
   - Set content status (progress, success, error) and messages

5. **Implement error handling**:
   - Set error status and messages if issues occur

6. **Finalize the response**:
   - Call `self.output_message.publish()` to emit final state and persist session
   - Return an `AgentResponse` with result, message, and data

7. **Register the agent**:
   - Import your new agent class in `Director/backend/director/handler.py`
   - Add it to the `self.agents` list in `ChatHandler`

Remember to consider creating reusable tools if your agent's functionality could be shared across multiple agents.
